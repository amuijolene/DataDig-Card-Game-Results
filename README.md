## Project Overview
The card game results data was utilized to experiment with advanced SQL queries to uncover insights. Queries were used to calculate basic statistics like **AVERAGE**, **MAX**, and **MIN** values. Categorical data was analyzed using **GROUP BY** and **HAVING** clauses. The **CASE** statement was employed to create new data categories, and **WHERE** clause with **AND** and **OR** operators were used to filter the data. 


## Data Breakdown
This project analyzes the results of friendly card games played among four friends: Spunky Sam, Marcimus, Winston, and Hopper. The games were played every Wednesday night throughout the winter. The number of games varied each night, with some nights featuring two different games. The number of players also fluctuated, ranging from three to four, with occasional fill-ins. The player with the highest score in each game was declared the winner. 

## Tools
My SQL Workbench was used to create a new database and schema for the card games results dataset. Also, it was used to execute SQL queries.

## Key Insights
- Rummy was the most frequently played game
- Pitch is the least popular among the friend group
- Spanky Sam and Marcimus were highly present and participated in every game
 

## Recommendations

- Develop a system to recommend game types based on a player's score.
- Implement a matchmaking system that pairs players with similar skill levels to create more competitive and enjoyable games.
